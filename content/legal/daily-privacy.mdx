# Privacy Policy

Daily Limited (“we”, “us”, “our”) believe that transparency is the key to any healthy relationship. We appreciate that you trust us with information about you, and we want to be transparent about how we use it.
This privacy policy (“notice”) describes how your personal data is processed by Me+ (“the app”, “the services”) and us. You will learn about the data we collect, how we use it, your rights, and the measures we take to keep it safe. We always make sure that your data is protected in accordance with applicable legislation.
You own your personal data. Therefore, we offer you several ways to control the privacy of your personal information and we are constantly striving to improve the functions and features needed in order for you to be in control.
We will process your personal data only in accordance with your consent and applicable legislation, such as the GDPR. We are not the data controller for personal data that is processed locally on your device.
If you have any questions, or feel you need any part of this notice explained, please contact us.

## General information about the app

When using the app, you will enter certain personal data into the app (such as your email address, when you go to bed and wake up, etc.), some personal data will be collected through your device’s accelerometer (such as your movements), microphone (such as snoring or other noises), camera (pulse), or device location (for weather and sleep location statistics), and some personal data will be derived (such as sleep efficiency and sleep quality).
Depending on what personal data you choose to provide, the data processed within the app may, alone or together with other data, indicate information about your health. Personal data, including health data, may also be collected from other sources. You have control over what data are stored and accessed between the different apps and you can modify these settings at any time.
Additionally, if you create or log into your account through a social media service account, we will have access to certain information from that account, such as your name and other account information, in accordance with the authorization procedures set by that social media service.
Please note that this notice does not apply to third party products or services or the practices of companies that we do not own or control, including other companies you might interact with, in or through the app, unless indicated otherwise. We will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such third party apps or sites (ii) the content, products or services on or availability of such third party apps or sites; or (iii) your use of any such third party apps or sites.

### Store your sleep data on our servers

To protect your health data (i.e. sleep data) from loss you can choose to use our backup service by creating an account in the app. Then, we ensure that your health data are saved even if something would happen to the app on your device. We will store all the data available in the app on our secure servers, hosted by Amazon Web Services, Inc. (Learn more about Amazon Web Services under “How we share your personal data and who we share it with”.)
We will keep your health data in the backup until you withdraw your consent by deleting your account in the app. If you withdraw your consent we will immediately delete or anonymise your health data. If you unsubscribe to the app, we will keep your data for up to one (1) year, in case you change your mind within this period of time and want to start a new subscription. We will delete or anonymise your data one (1) year after you unsubscribe.
As you may understand, this means that your data may be processed both within the United States, as well as in other locations outside the United States. In addition, your data will generally be encrypted during transit and rest, and the data stored by us and Amazon Web Services will be pseudonymised.

### Help us improve the app

We appreciate if you would like to help us improve the app by contributing with your health data. If we know how you are using the app, know about your sleep patterns and surrounding circumstances, etc. we can improve the app – this will make our, and ultimately your, insights better and more to the point and this will also improve your user experience.
Whenever you use our app, we collect usage information, such as the sessions you use, videos you view or music you listen to, what screens or features you access, and other similar types of usage information. For this purpose, we will only use pseudonymised data, meaning that your health data will be awarded a hashed ID.
The pseudonymised data will be stored in our product development environment (separate from the backup environment) and their service provider Amazon Web Services. (Learn more Amazon Web Services under “How we share your personal data and who we share it with”.)
We will keep your pseudonymised data until you withdraw your consent or up to one(1) years from collection, whichever is longer. If you withdraw your consent we will immediately delete your pseudonymised health data.

In some scenarios, we may use your data and personal information to detect, investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities so as to protect the rights and property of us and others, including to enforce our agreements and policies. If you feel your transaction was declined in error, please contact us for assistance at hello@sago.studio.

### Promote the app or enable campaigns

With your consent, we may use your personal information to facilitate contests, sweepstakes, and promotions and process and deliver entries and rewards. You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from us by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.

### How we share your personal data and who we share it with

We also use other service providers that may process your data on our behalf. When we communicate with you, for example via e-mail, your e-mail address may be transferred to Microsoft, who provide e-mail and communication services.

## Your rights

You can exercise many of your rights directly in the app or on your device. You are always welcome to contact us directly and we will help you with your request.

### Right to information and access

You have the right to know if we process personal data about you. If we do, you also have the right to receive information about the personal data we process and why we do it. You also have the right to receive a copy of all personal data we have about you.

If you are interested in specific information, please indicate it in your request. For example, you can specify if you are interested in a certain type of information (e.g. what contact and identification information we have about you) or if you want information from a certain time period.

### Right to have erroneous data corrected

If the data we hold about you are incorrect, you have the right to have it corrected. You also have the right to supplement incomplete information with additional information that may be needed for the information to be correct.

Once we have corrected your data, or it has been supplemented, we will inform those we have shared your data with about the update, provided that it is not impossible or too cumbersome. If you ask us, we will also tell you who we have shared your data with.

If you request to have data corrected, you also have the right to request that we limit our processing during the time we investigate the matter.

### Right to have data deleted

In some cases, you have the right to have your data deleted. You have the right to have your data deleted if:

1. The data is no longer needed for the purposes for which we collected it,

2. You withdraw your consent, if applicable,

3. The data is used for direct marketing and you unsubscribe from it,

4. You oppose use that is based on our legitimate interest and we cannot show compelling grounds that outweigh your interests,

5. The personal data has been used illegally, or

6. Deletion is required to fulfill a legal obligation.

You can delete specific data points, for example sleep sessions or comments posted by yourself, directly in the app. If you are not using the online backup services you can simply just uninstall the app in order to remove any stored data. If you choose to delete your account (or if you withdraw your consent), please note that while most of your information will be deleted within a few days, it may take up to thirty (30) days to delete all of your information, like the data stored in our backup systems. We may preserve data for legal reasons or to prevent harm.

If we delete data following your request, we will also inform those we have shared your data with, provided that it is not impossible or too cumbersome. If you ask us, we will also tell you who we have shared your data with.

### Objecting to data use

You have the right to object to processing that is based on our legitimate interest. If you object to the use, we will, based on your particular situation, evaluate if our interests in using the data outweigh your interests in the data not being used for that purpose. If we are unable to provide compelling legitimate grounds that outweigh yours, we will stop using the data you object to – provided we do not have to use the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. If you object to the use, you also have the right to request that we restrict our use during the time we investigate the matter.

You always have the right to object to, and thus unsubscribe from, direct marketing.

### Right to withdraw consent

You have the right to withdraw your consent for a specific processing at any time. You can withdraw your consent in the privacy settings by contacting us at hello@sago.studio.

Your withdrawal will not affect processing that has already been carried out.

### Right to turn off mobile push notifications/alerts

With your consent, we send promotional and other push notifications to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.

### Right to request restriction

Restriction means that the data is marked so that it may only be used for certain limited purposes. The right to restriction applies:

1. When you believe the data are incorrect and you have requested correction. If so, you can also request that we limit our use while we investigate if the data are correct or not.

2. If the use is illegal but you do not want the data to be deleted.

3. When we no longer need the data for the purposes for which we collected it, but you need it to be able to establish, assert or defend legal claims.

4. If you object to the use. If so, you can request that we limit our use while we investigate if our interest in processing your data outweighs your interests.

Even if you have requested that we restrict our use of your data, we may also use the information for reasons relating to an important public interest.
