(“Lingo Real,” “us,” or “we”). Access and use of the Service is subject to the following Terms and Conditions of Service (“Terms and Conditions”). By accessing or using any part of the Service, you represent that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions including any future modifications. Lingo Real may amend, update, or change these Terms and Conditions. If we do this, we will post a notice that we have made changes to these Terms and Conditions on the Websites for at least 7 days after the changes are posted and will indicate at the bottom of the Terms and Conditions the date these terms were last revised. Any revisions to these Terms and Conditions will become effective the earlier of (i) the end of such 7-day period or (ii) the first time you access or use the Service after such changes. If you do not agree to abide by these Terms and Conditions, you are not authorized to use, access, or participate in the Service.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS. VIEW THESE TERMS HERE.

## In-App Purchases

If you purchase an auto-renewing periodic subscription through the Service, your Lingo Real account will be billed continuously for the subscription until you terminate it as set forth below. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically renew for an additional equivalent period. If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your Lingo Real account and follow instructions to terminate or change your subscription, even if you have deleted your account.

All payments are nonrefundable. There are no refunds or credits for Virtual Items or partially used membership periods. However, Lingo Real may grant refunds or credits on a case-by-case basis at our sole discretion. Lingo Real’s grant of a refund or credit in one instance does not obligate Lingo Real to provide a refund or credit in the future, under any circumstances. If you cancel your periodic subscription to a paid Lingo Real service, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period.

## Third-Party Links, Sites, and Services

Please consult your legal counsel for further details or see 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3). Lingo Real’s Agent for Notice of claims of copyright infringement can be reached as follows:

By email: hello@sago.studio

For clarity, only copyright infringement notices should go to our Copyright Agent. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section your notice may not be valid.

If you believe the content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use such content, you may submit a counter-notice to the address listed above containing the following information:

Your physical or electronic signature;
Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and
Your name, physical address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in the judicial district in which you reside, or if you reside outside of the United States, then of the federal court in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

Please note that when we forward the counter-notification, it includes your personal information. By submitting a counter-notification, you consent to having your information revealed in this way. We will not forward the counter-notification to any party other than the original claimant.

After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within 10 days that he or she has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content that was removed or disabled. If we receive such notification, we will be unable to restore the material. If we do not receive such notification, we may reinstate the material.

These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, United States of America, excluding any conflict of laws provisions, regardless of your country of origin or where you access the Service.

## Choice of Forum

Subject to Section 24 (Dispute Resolution & Arbitration), all judicial proceedings relating to or arising out of these Terms and Conditions or the Service shall be brought in the state or federal courts sitting in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Both parties hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and waive any objections to venue in those courts.

## Dispute Resolution & Arbitration

ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR THE SERVICE AND SEEKING MONETARY RELIEF SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ACCORDING TO THIS SECTION.

Prior to initiating any arbitration, the party seeking arbitration (“Claimant”) must first send a written Notice of Claim to the other party (“Respondent”) by email or USPS Certified Mail. This Notice must contain the Claimant’s name, address, and contact information; the identity of counsel (if any); the nature and basis of the claim; and the specific relief sought. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Notice, the parties shall engage in at least one good-faith settlement conference by telephone or video conference. An individual party must be personally present at this settlement conference, and an entity party must be present at this settlement conference through an employee with settlement authority, though both parties may bring counsel as well. Arbitration shall be initiated only if no settlement can be reached at this settlement conference.

The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) according to its Consumer Arbitration Rules, Procedures for the Resolution of Disputes Through Document Submission, Consumer Fee Schedule, and Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings (“AAA Rules”), and the provisions of this section. Where they conflict, the provisions of this section shall take precedence over any AAA Rules. If the AAA is unavailable to conduct an arbitration, the parties shall arbitrate through another mutually agreed upon organization or on an ad hoc basis according to the rules in this section. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.

If a claim is within the jurisdiction of a small claims court, either party may choose to have the case heard in the small claims court on an individual basis, instead of arbitration.

If twenty-five (25) or more similar Demands for Arbitration are filed against or on behalf of the same party or related parties, and if representation of the parties is consistent or coordinated across the cases, then the AAA’s Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings shall apply. Counsel filing twenty-five (25) or more similar Demands for Arbitration against Lingo Real must comply with the AAA’s Filing Requirements for Multiple Case Filings. There shall be no class or collective arbitration, or joinder of claims, except as provided for in the AAA’s Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings.

If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Lingo Real and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to legal@Lingo Real.com within 30 days of the day you first access or use the Service.

Notwithstanding the above, either party may apply for and obtain non-monetary, injunctive remedies or urgent relief in court without engaging in any arbitration or informal dispute resolution process.
