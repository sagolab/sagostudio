# Terms of Service

If your usual residence is outside of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland
**Please read carefully:** These Terms of Service (these “**Terms**”) constitute a legally binding agreement between you (“**you**” or “**your**”) and Sago
S.p.A. (“we” or “us”), the parent company of Splice Video Editor
S.r.l., concerning the use of the Mero mobile application (“app”)
and any other interactions with us. We present this Privacy Policy in
compliance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 – General Data Protection
Regulation (“GDPR”), the Italian Legislative Decree 196/2003 (as
amended), and other applicable local laws, as amended or replaced
(collectively, “Applicable Privacy Laws”).
These Terms govern your access and use of our websites where these Terms are posted (the “**Site**”), our mobile applications (the “**App**”), and our related content, products, and services (collectively, and together with the Site and the App, “**Product**” or “**Products**”).
**THESE TERMS CONTAIN VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS CONDITIONS, LIMITATIONS, DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES, AND EXCLUSIONS THAT MIGHT APPLY TO YOU. THESE TERMS ALSO CONTAIN PROVISIONS REGARDING THE AUTOMATIC RENEWING OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION. THESE TERMS REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS. PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY.**
By downloading, installing or using the Products in any manner, you agree to these Terms and you agree to comply with and be bound by any applicable specific, supplemental or third-party licenses or terms when using any Product.
**IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS AND IMMEDIATELY STOP USING THE PRODUCTS, CANCEL ANY ACCOUNT, AND IMMEDIATELY UNINSTALL AND DELETE ANY COPIES OF THE PRODUCTS IN YOUR POSSESSION.**
These Terms were originally drafted in English. If there is any conflict between the English-language version of these Terms and a version translated into another language, the English-language version will prevail.

## 1. Changes to Terms and Products

We may update these Terms from time to time, in our sole discretion. In such cases, we will take reasonable measures to inform you, in accordance with the significance of the changes performed, for example, by revising the date at the top of the updated Terms, via email or as a pop-up or push notification within the Products. It is your responsibility to review the Terms regularly, and to check the Product for updates to these Terms regularly. Unless otherwise noted, the updated Terms will be effective as of the time at which we post the updated Terms in the Product. By continuing to access or use our Product after updates become effective, you agree to be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must immediately stop using our Products, uninstall and delete any copies in your possession, and cancel your subscription and any account.
We may also update, change, suspend or discontinue any of the Products (or any part, content or feature) at any time, without notice and without liability to you or anyone else.
Some products and features may not be available in all countries or in all languages.

## 2. Privacy

Please refer to the applicable privacy policy for information on how we process your personal data, treat your information and protect your privacy when you use the Products:

## 3. Eligibility

**OUR PRODUCTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE AGE OF 16.** If you are over the age of 16 but under the legal age of majority in your state of residence, your parent or guardian must review and agree to be bound by these Terms on your behalf and must supervise your use of the Products.
**YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE OR ORDER, ACCESS OR USE ANY PRODUCTS IF YOU (A) DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, (B) ARE NOT OF LEGAL AGE TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT WITH Sago OR YOUR PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN HAS NOT AGREED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE PRODUCTS, OR (C) ARE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW FROM ACCESSING OR USING ANY PRODUCT.**

## 4. End User License

Subject to your compliance with these Terms and your payment of the applicable subscription fees, we hereby grant you, for your personal and non-commercial purposes, a limited, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license to use the Products and to download and install a copy of the applicable App on a permitted device that you own or control.
Except as expressly permitted by these Terms and the terms applicable to the mobile application store where we make the applicable App available (each, a “**App Marketplace**”), you cannot: (a) rent, lease, lend, sell, distribute, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or make available the Products; or (b) copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, alter, mimic, adapt, translate, or create derivative works of the Products, any updates, content or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open source components included with the Products).

## 5. Purchases, Subscriptions, Promotional Codes, and Auto Renewals

We may offer free trials in our sole discretion. Upon installation or expiration of a free trial offer (if applicable), or a redeemed Virtual Item or Promotional Code, you will be charged the applicable subscription fees (if any) for your use of the Products. **Upon expiration of the initial term of your subscription, whether such subscription is weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, or otherwise, your subscription will automatically renew for recurring subscription periods of the same duration unless and until you affirmatively cancel your subscription. If you have purchased your subscription through the App, you can cancel your subscription or automatic renewals any time in your account settings with the App Marketplace according to the policies of each App Marketplace.** **If you have purchased your subscription through the Site, you can manage and cancel your subscription and any automatic renewals at any time following the instructions in your subscription purchase or renewal confirmation emails, or by following the instructions in the Product’s support page.** Uninstalling a Product will not result in the cancellation of your subscription. If you have begun a subscription period and you then decide to cancel your subscription during such period, you will not receive a refund for the fees you already paid for such subscription period, and you will continue to be able to use the Products for which you subscribed until the end of such subscription period. We may change the applicable subscription fees at any time at our sole discretion. Changes to the subscription fees will not apply retroactively.
The Products may enable you to purchase a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use virtual items or in-app consumables (collectively, the “**Virtual Items**”), which could include virtual cards, tokens or other units that can be redeemed for additional features, enhancements, functionalities, content, or services within the Products. You are only allowed to purchase Virtual Items through the Products and you may only redeem or use Virtual Items through the Product in which the Virtual Items are purchased. We may manage, regulate, change, or remove Virtual Items at any time at our sole discretion. **All consumable in-app purchases made through the Products and all Virtual Items (and all redemptions of Virtual Items) are final and non-refundable. You acknowledge that you will not receive any refund or compensation for unused Virtual Items when your access to the Products or your account (if any) is suspended or terminated for any reason.**
We may provide you with gift cards or promotional codes that can be redeemed for additional features, enhancements, functionalities, content, services, or Virtual Items within a specified Product and for a limited period of time, subject eligibility requirements (the “**Promotional Codes**”). Promotional Codes have no cash value, are personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and we are under no obligation to provide any compensation in connection with a Promotional Code. The Products may require that you create or log in to your account to use Promotional Codes.
The validity of these Terms and the validity of any purchase associated with the Products will be considered independently from each other, meaning that the termination of such associated purchase will not affect the validity of these Terms, and the termination of these Terms may not affect the validity of such associated purchase.

## 18 Governing Law 

These Terms, and any dispute, claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims), or matters arising out of or in connection with these Terms will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the substantive laws of the State of Florida, U.S., excluding any conflict-of-laws rule or principle that might refer the governance or the construction of these Terms to the law of any other jurisdiction.

## 19 Binding Arbitration

The United States Federal Arbitration Act applies to these Terms. Except for small claims court cases that qualify (claims under US$ 10,000), any dispute, controversy or claim that in any way relates to or arises out of these Terms or Products you receive from us will be resolved by final and binding arbitration in accordance with and pursuant to the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The Tribunal will consist of one sole arbitrator. **UNLESS YOU AND WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK.** The language of the proceeding will be English. Any award issued by the Arbitrator will be final and binding and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. For claims of $10,000 or less, the party bringing the claim can choose either to arbitrate the claim (in which case the Expedited Procedures in the JAMS Comprehensive Rules will apply) or, alternatively, can bring an individual action in small claims court, in New York County, New York. You can get copies of procedures, rules and fee information from JAMS [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com) or by requesting them from us. Sago will be responsible for all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator’s costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration. You will be responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration.
**YOU AND Sago AGREE IRREVOCABLY TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT (EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT). IN ANY COURT PROCEEDING YOU AND Sago AGREE TO WAIVE AND RELINQUISH ALL RIGHT TO HAVE ANY MATTER TRIED BEFORE A JURY. YOU AND Sago ALSO AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS WILL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY, AND YOU WILL NOT BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OR RELATING TO A CONTRACT BASED ON THESE TERMS AND THE ARBITRATOR WILL HAVE THE POWER TO RULE ON ANY CHALLENGE TO ITS OWN JURISDICTION OR TO THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY PORTION OF THESE TERMS. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE OR MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. **
**YOU FURTHER AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY CLAIMS YOU ASSERT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. IN ANY DISPUTE, NEITHER YOU NOR Sago WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CUSTOMERS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY.**
**YOU CAN OPT-OUT OF THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES SET OUT IN THIS SECTION 19 (BINDING ARBITRATION) WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE TERMS (THE “OPT-OUT DEADLINE”). YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THIS PROVISION BY MAILING TO US WRITTEN NOTICE BY THE OPT-OUT DEADLINE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 20 (GENERAL).**

## 20 General

We may issue any notice that is required or referenced in these Terms to you by (a) email, (b) posting notice to the Products, or (c) other legally accepted means. It is your responsibility to keep your information current to receive notifications and to check the Product regularly (for example, by opening the App once a month). Notices sent by email will be effective when we send the email, and notices we provide by posting will be effective upon posting. To give us notice under these Terms, you must contact us as follows: (1) by email to [Sago@legalmail.it](mailto:Sago@legalmail.it), or (2) by personal delivery, overnight courier or registered or certified mail to Corso Como 15, 20154 Milan, Italy, Attention: Sago Legal. Notices provided by personal delivery will be effective immediately. Notices provided by email or overnight courier will be effective one business day after they are sent. Notices provided by registered or certified mail will be effective three business days after they are sent.
You will not assign, subcontract, delegate, or otherwise transfer these Terms, or your rights and obligations hereunder, without obtaining the prior written consent of an authorized representative of Sago, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be void. We may assign these Terms or delegate our obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without your consent, to any person or entity at any time.
Any failure by us to exercise or enforce any of our rights under these Terms does not waive our right to enforce such right. Any waiver of such rights will only be effective if it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Sago. The rights and remedies under these Terms are cumulative and are in addition to and not in substitution for any other rights and remedies available at law, in equity or otherwise.
If any provision, or part thereof, of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, that provision, or the affected part thereof, will be deemed amended so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Any invalid or unenforceable portion should be construed as narrowly as possible in order to give effect to as much of these Terms as possible. Any unaffected provision of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
These Terms will be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Except as expressly provided in section 7 (Our Intellectual Property Rights), 10 (Third-Party Services and Materials), 13 (Indemnification), 20 (General), 21 (Additional Terms for App Marketplaces), and 22 (Additional Terms for Shutterstock Content) there are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.
Any delay in the performance of any duties or obligations of either party (except the payment of money owed) will not be considered a breach of these Terms to the extent such delay is caused by a labor dispute, shortage of materials, fire, earthquake, epidemic, flood, act of terrorism, or any other event beyond the control of such party.

## 21 Additional Terms for App Marketplaces

When you access, purchase or download the App from the Apple App Store, you acknowledge and agree that:

- Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.
- In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App to you where applicable. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of Sago.
- Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (c) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation.
- In the event of any third-party claim that the App or your possession and use of the App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between Apple and Sago, Sago will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.
