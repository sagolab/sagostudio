Our Services do not respond to Do Not Track signals. 

### c. Information We Collect When You Call Us
We may monitor or record phone or video calls with you for quality purposes. Our customer service team members also enter certain personal information you provide into our customer service databases to ensure continuity and consistency throughout your experience with DKRA.

### d. Information We Collect from Partners, Service Providers, and Affiliated Businesses
We may collect information about you from our partners, service providers, and affiliated businesses in order to provide the Services, along with certain related products and services such as home financing, title insurance, escrow services, homebuilder partnership programs, real estate agent partnership programs, and, in cases where DKRA is not able to buy your home, other potential purchasers or brokers, or to listing agents who may be able to help with your home sale. 

Information we gather about you from our partners, service providers, and affiliated businesses may include:

Multiple Listing Service (MLS) information about your home or the home(s) you are interested in buying;
Prequalification letters from financial institutions;
Construction or purchase contracts;
Verification of your identification and a risk score about you prior to allowing you smart-lock-enabled entry into an DKRA-owned home;
Information related to completion of the construction of your new home (if you are working with a homebuilder);
Information about the condition of, and repairs to, your home and property;
Information related to your home purchase, sale, moving dates, and financing in connection with helping us facilitate “trade-in” deals;
Information about whether you may need homeowners insurance; or
Information about how you engaged with the DKRA website, such as
recording clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, keystrokes, and other information about your browsing session, or how you engaged with an DKRA advertisement or social media post.
Our service providers may collect information on our behalf. For example, third parties that we engage may collect information about your online activities over time and across different Websites when you use our Services.

### e. Information We Collect from Public Sources
Much of the information necessary to help you buy or sell your home is available from public sources, such as government entities. We sometimes collect information from these sources so that you do not have to spend time looking for and aggregating it for us. For example, we may collect the following information about you and your home from public sources:

Tax assessments of your home;
The school district and public transportation available near your home;
Information contained on the deed to your home, such as name, address, liens, encumbrances, and title;
Sale prices of homes similar to your home (called “comparables”);
The number of bedrooms and bathrooms in your home; 
Whether your home has access to features like a beach, boat dock, or parking garage;
Whether your home is in an earthquake or flood zone or has any other condition that would affect its market value;
Permits issued for remodels and additions; 
The finished and unfinished square footage of your home; or 
The year your home was built.
### f. Information We Collect Through Our Mobile Applications
When you access our Services through our mobile applications, we may receive certain mobile device data such as a unique identification number associated with your device, your device type and manufacturer, your mobile carrier, subscriber status, payment method, phone number, caller ID data, or, depending on your mobile device settings, your location information, including GPS coordinates. This information may also include a recording of your clicks, scrolls, keystrokes, and other information about
your mobile app session.

We generally collect this information to provide and improve your experience with the Services and to verify the identity and location of people who access DKRA homes. This helps us keep you and our properties safe. 

When you first launch our application or when you use it to visit an DKRA home, you may be asked to allow us to access your geographic location. If you initially consent to this and change your mind, you can revoke your consent by changing the geolocation preferences in your device settings.

### g. Information We Collect When You Visit an DKRA Home
If you use our application to unlock an DKRA home, we will know the date and time the home was unlocked. Some of our homes also have additional monitoring technologies such as motion sensors that tell us when there is activity in a house and video cameras monitored by a security service provider. 

We may also request that you use your smart device to verify your identity by uploading an image of a government ID before we remotely unlock a home. We use an identity verification service provider to manage our ID verification. DKRA does not maintain a copy of your ID after you upload it and typically would only obtain it from our identity verification service provider in connection with a significant trust and safety incident, or if requested by law enforcement. We do, however, retain certain personal information obtained from the ID such as your name, address, and whether you are over the age of 18 (but not your specific date of birth). 

There are some situations where we cannot get enough information from you to remotely unlock the door to one of our homes using a smart lock. When this happens, you can still tour the home with the help of a real estate agent.

### h. Information We Collect Through Estimated Offers Via Text
Data obtained through the short code program will not be shared with any third-parties for their marketing reasons/purposes. 

All the above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties.

## 3. How We Use This Information
### a. To Provide Our Services
We use the information that we collect about you to deliver our Services, including to personalize features and content to you. We use the information to give you options for home buying and selling that may be relevant to your individual circumstances. As discussed in more detail below, you have choices about how and whether we process some of your information. 

### b. To Learn About the Home You May Want to Sell or Buy
If you are interested in selling, we use information you provide to us about the home, including photos and videos, to help us provide the Services to you and others. If you are interested in buying a home, we may consider information you provide us about the home you are interested in buying, including property profiles that you have indicated your interest in, to try to match you with homes you might want to purchase.

### c. To Keep You, Your Information, and Our Properties Safe
DKRA cares about your safety. We use the monitoring and identity verification technologies described above to help keep you safe when you visit an DKRA home and to prevent property damage and fraud.

### d. To Advertise Our Services
We may use information collected about you to provide you with relevant information about additional Services that DKRA or our affiliated companies offer, such as our trade-in program, home financing, and title insurance services. Specifically, we use information about how you interact with our Services, combined with information you provide us and information we collect from other sources, to serve you relevant advertising.

You may have additional choices available to you with regards to some online behavioral advertising cookies. Please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance at https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&amp;lang=EN or the Network Advertising Initiative at https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1 for more information.

For other privacy choices made available by Google, you can visit: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en-US.

### e. To Do Market Research
We are constantly striving to improve our customer experience. We conduct research into all aspects of the home buying and selling process to try to identify ways to make it better. Sometimes we use partner companies to conduct surveys of willing participants who offer suggestions as to how we might improve our Services. We also aggregate and analyze consumer information that we collect through our Services and from conversations with our customer service representatives to identify trends, which inform how we change and grow.  

### f. To Support Information Security and Debugging
We may use information about you and your use of the Services to detect security incidents, protect against malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity, and improve the security of our Services. We may also use this information to debug our Services to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.

### g. In Connection with a Dispute
We may use personal information to prosecute or defend against claims in court and other dispute resolution forums.

### h. Uses of Device Information
We generally use this information for your convenience and to improve our Services. For instance, we may use it to: (i) remember your personal information so that you do not have to re-enter it; (ii) provide you with customized content and information, including advertising; (iii) monitor the effectiveness of our Services; (iv) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and usage patterns; or (v) diagnose or fix technology problems.

DKRA is not a data broker. We have not sold your personal information to any third parties in the past 12 months. We have no actual knowledge that we have sold any personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.

However, in some circumstances we disclose your information to third parties not owned by or co-branded with DKRA. Specifically:

The due diligence provider may use this information to inform and further refine its risk analysis tools. We may disclose your information to services that perform various checks, including, but not limited to, background checks and credit checks, as permitted by law.
### b. “Sharing” Your Data
We do not share your personal information with third parties for cross-contextual behavioral advertising.

## 6. How We Protect Your Information
### a. Safeguards
We use commercially reasonable physical, electronic, administrative, and procedural safeguards to preserve the integrity, confidentiality, and security of all personal information collected through the Services. However, no security measure, system, or control is infallible. Therefore, like all businesses, we cannot guarantee that our Services are invulnerable to attack or misuse.

### b. Your Role
You have a major role in the security and privacy of your own information. For example, you should not provide us with personal information that we do not request. Additionally, you are responsible for controlling access to any personal computing device through which your information may be stored or accessed. You are also responsible for safeguarding any passwords or other log-in credentials that may be used to access your information, including in the DKRA environment. We recommend that you log out of any account when you are done using it.

### c. Third Parties
Please remember to review the privacy settings and security policies of third-party sites and services that you use, such as social media networks. We are not responsible for the privacy or security measures of any third party.

### d. Incident Response
In the event that the security of any personal information under our control is compromised, we will take reasonable steps to investigate and mitigate the situation, including, when appropriate, notifying those individuals whose information may have been compromised and taking other steps in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

## 7. Opting Out of Our Communications
If you are interested in no longer being contacted by DKRA, we want to facilitate that.  You may click on the unsubscribe links in our marketing emails, text STOP in response to marketing texts, and request removal from our mailer list at dkra.vn/mail.

You may exercise any of your rights outlined above by going to dkra.vn

Only you or a duly authorized agent may make a CCPA request on your behalf. If you are an authorized agent making a request on behalf of a California resident, please call us. To process your request, our team may require identity verification. In some instances, we may decline to honor your request where an exception under law applies.

You have the right to make a free request twice during any twelve-month period. The request must:

Provide sufficient information for us to reasonably verify that you are the person, or an authorized representative of the person, about whom we collected the personal information or sensitive personal information; and
Describe your request with sufficient detail for us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to the request.
Submitting a request does not require you to create an account with us. However, for your safety and the safety of your information, we cannot fulfill a request to provide or delete personal information or sensitive personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information or sensitive personal information relates to you or an individual for whom you are an authorized agent. We may require additional verification before deleting or disclosing particularly sensitive information. We will only use the verification information you provide for the purpose of verifying your identity or authority to make the request.

We do not charge you a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request, unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
