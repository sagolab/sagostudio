# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) governs the processing of
personal data belonging to users (“user” or “you”) by Sago
S.p.A. (“we” or “us”), the parent company of Splice Video Editor
S.r.l., concerning the use of the Mero mobile application (“app”)
and any other interactions with us. We present this Privacy Policy in
compliance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 – General Data Protection
Regulation (“GDPR”), the Italian Legislative Decree 196/2003 (as
amended), and other applicable local laws, as amended or replaced
(collectively, “Applicable Privacy Laws”).

## 1. Data Controller and Data Protection Officer

The Data Controller is SAGOLAB S.p.A., with its registered office at
Seoul(서울 서초구 서초대로 275 2F 202호/Busan) 부산 해운대구
마린시티2로 2 1506-105호 (Korea). For any queries concerning the
processing of your personal data, please contact us at
privacy@sagolab.com.

Our Data Protection Officer can be reached by sending an email to
dpo@sagolab.com for any inquiries related to the processing of your
personal data or this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Categories of Personal Data that We Collect, Purposes and Legal Bases for Our Processing

### Provision of the Service

To enable you to use the app and to provide you with its functionalities. For example, we may process your data to enable you to edit or enhance your photos and videos, and generate AI images of yourself. Additionally, we may process your data to show you information about the app and your editing or enhancing process and suggest the best images to edit with Mero.

****Legal Basis****: Contractual Relationship
Our contractual relationship provides the legal grounds for processing this data for this purpose (article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR).

****Categories of Processed Data****: Identifiers, Internet and network activity information, and more

- Identifiers (such as IP address, device model, device type, OS version, device language, device name, country set in the device settings, information about your interactions with the app, and unique identifiers), and other information necessary to enable you to use the app.

### Processing Images and Videos

The app processes the images, videos, and audio recordings that you upload, including images containing faces, as well as the images generated by the app (enhanced photos and videos and AI images). When images contain faces, we process certain information about them, such as information that estimates the location of parts and areas of the faces (“Facial Data”). Note that in some jurisdictions outside of Europe, Facial Data may be considered biometric data. The photo-video editing, enhancing, and generative technologies implemented in the app do not allow unique identification or authentication of people in the images, nor are we training the technologies to do so. This means that we only use the app to create the requested AI images based on the images containing faces shared by the user.

### Access to Photo and Video Library

To edit photos and videos or generate AI images, the app needs access to your photo and video library and your camera. The app requires that you expressly allow this access, through a request appearing on your mobile device.

### Service Improvement

To improve and develop our products and services. For example, we process your data by conducting statistical analysis or other research activities to optimize our features and provide you with new ones. Identifiers (such as name, social media handle, or email address, when requested), Internet and network activity information (such as IP address), inferences we generate, your gender (if you choose to share this information), and other related information about your usage of and experience with the app. For the purpose of statistical analysis, we may also collect information and metadata related to your images, videos, and audio recordings. In such cases, we will only process anonymized data. See below for details about how we use the images, videos, and audio recordings you upload, as well as Facial Data to improve our photo-video editing, enhancing, and generative features, and train our photo-video editing, enhancing, and generative algorithms.

****Legal Basis****: Legitimate Interest

- Our legitimate interest to improve our products and services provides the legal grounds for processing this data for this purpose (article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR).

****Categories of Processed Data****: Inferences and more

- For the purpose of statistical analysis, we may also collect information and metadata related to your images, videos, and audio recordings. In such cases, we will only process anonymized data.

### Editing and Enhancement Improvement

To improve our photo-video editing, enhancing, and generative features in Mero and in other photo-video editing apps provided by us and our subsidiary companies, and to offer a better service for editing, enhancing, and generating your images and videos. Your consent provides the legal grounds for processing this data for this purpose. If you haven’t explicitly granted this consent, we do not perform these actions. You can check and update the permissions you have granted via the app’s privacy settings. The images, videos, and audio recordings you upload, as well as Facial Data, if you expressly give your consent for this specific purpose. As described above, while Facial Data may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions outside of Europe, the technologies implemented in the app do not allow or aim at performing a unique identification or authentication of people in the images, nor are we training the technologies to do so. We do not collect or use Facial Data of US-based users to improve our photo-video editing, enhancing, and generative features nor to train our photo-video editor algorithms.

****Legal Basis****: Consent

- Your consent provides the legal grounds for processing this data for this purpose (article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR).

## 12. In-App Tracking Technologies

When we refer to “tracking technology/technologies” in this Policy, we mean any technology that stores or accesses information on the user’s device, including SDKs, tracking pixels, HTML5 local storage, local shared objects, and fingerprinting techniques.


Tracking technologies are usually classified by purpose (Technical, Analytics, Profiling) and by publisher (First-party, Third-party).


Applicable legal requirements vary based on how the tracking technologies are classified.


Below you will find the types of tracking technologies by classification along with some practical examples.


**By purpose**


**Technical tracking technologies**


Technical tracking technologies are used for the purpose of transmitting messages over an electronic communication network or to provide a service specifically requested by the user.


Thus, technical tracking technologies are essential for the correct functioning of the app and to provide the service offered to and requested by the user.


For example, technical tracking technologies can be used to monitor sessions, store specific server access information related to the user configuration, facilitate the use of online content, or keep track of items in a shopping cart or information used to fill in a form.


Technical tracking technologies do not need your consent.


**Analytics tracking technologies**


Analytics tracking technologies may be used to assess the effectiveness of an information society service provided by a publisher, evaluate and improve the design of an app, or help measure traffic.


In other words, analytics tracking technologies may be used to track the traffic and performance of an app by collecting aggregate data on the number of users and how they interact with the app to improve its services.


For example, analytics tracking technologies may collect information about how users access an app, including the number of users, possibly grouped by geographical area, time zone, how long users stay on the app, which parts of the app they interact with, or the number of users who used a particular feature.


Analytics tracking technologies need your explicit consent. However, analytics tracking technologies are equated to technical trackers and, thus, do not need your consent if:


they are only used to produce aggregated statistics that are performed by way of the controller’s own resources and do not turn into activities that go beyond statistical counting and enable business-related decision-making; or
the third parties do not match the analytics trackers' data with any other information and do not forward such data to other third parties.


**Profiling tracking technologies**


Profiling tracking technologies may be used to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to users and trace specific actions or recurring behavioral patterns in the use of the offered functionalities back to specific, identified or identifiable individuals for the purpose of grouping them within homogeneous, multi-sized clusters. This is aimed at enabling the company to analyze and predict personal aspects concerning the users, provide them with increasingly customized services beyond what is strictly necessary for the delivery of the service, and send targeted advertising messages in line with the preferences expressed by the user during their in-app activities.


In other words, profiling tracking technologies may be used to convey behavioral advertising, measure the effectiveness of ads, or customize the services offered in line with the user’s monitored behavior.


For example, profiling tracking technologies can be used to create user profiles and offer content in line with the user’s interests, send targeted ads or messages, or conduct statistical analysis or other research activities to improve our products and services and measure the effectiveness of our campaigns.


Profiling tracking technologies need your explicit consent.

## By publisher

**First-party tracking technologies**


First-party tracking technologies are installed and managed directly by the owner of the app which will process the collected data for its own purposes.


**Third-party tracking technologies**


Third-party tracking technologies are installed and managed by different apps or developers either for our purposes or for the third party’s own purposes.


The data collected by these third parties is governed by their own specific privacy policies and terms and conditions over which we have no control. Thus, for further information about these data processing activities, please refer to the privacy policy of such third parties as indicated in the following section ("Types of tracking technologies used by the app”).


Third-party non-anonymized analytics and/or profiling trackers need your consent. You can manage this consent at any time by accessing the “Privacy Settings” within the app.

## Tracking technologies settings

You can activate or disable (in whole or in part) profiling and third-party analytics tracking technologies at any time through the “Privacy Settings” within the app.


When you withdraw your consent, your data will no longer be collected through those trackers but we will continue processing the data collected before the withdrawal.


You cannot deactivate first-party analytics tracking technologies since they are equated to technical trackers and, thus, are not based on your consent. However, you can opt out of the further processing of your data collected by means of such trackers by sending an email to privacy@sagolab.com.


With regards to your rights under applicable Data Protection Laws, please refer to Section 7 (Your Rights) above.
